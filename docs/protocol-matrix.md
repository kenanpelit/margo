# Protocol verification matrix — advertised vs implemented vs tested

> **Last refreshed:** 2026-06-01 (`main`)
> **Companion doc:** [`protocol-comparison.md`](protocol-comparison.md) answers
> *"what does each compositor advertise?"* (cross-project surface count).
> **This** doc answers a different, internal question: *"for every protocol
> **margo** advertises, how do we know it actually works?"* — the gap between
> "the global is in the registry" and "a client round-trips against it in CI."

This is a maturity ledger, not a marketing sheet. A protocol can be
`advertised ✅` and `implemented ✅` yet have **no automated coverage** — that
is exactly the row this table exists to surface, so the snapshot/integration
backlog (`road_map.md` §15.2, test coverage) is driven by evidence, not vibes.

## How the columns are derived (so they stay honest)

| Column | ✅ means | Source of truth |
|---|---|---|
| **Advertised** | global bound into the registry at startup | `State::new` in `margo/src/state.rs` (the `*State::new::<Self>(&dh)` calls) + the `delegate_*!` macro set |
| **Implemented** | real handler logic, not an advertise-only stub | the `*Handler` impls / `margo/src/protocols/*.rs` for hand-rolled ones; ⚠️ = partial (read-only, or a documented caveat) |
| **Runtime-tested** | a live Wayland client exercises it | 🟢 headless integration fixture in `margo/src/tests/` (real `MargoState` + nested client over a `UnixStream`, run in CI); 🟡 manual on-hardware only ([`manual-checklist.md`](manual-checklist.md)); ❌ neither |
| **Unit / snapshot-tested** | pure-unit or `insta` snapshot coverage | `#[test]` in the owning module / `insta::assert_snapshot!`; ❌ = none |
| **Known gaps** | the caveat a maintainer must know | — |

**Why two test columns.** They catch different bug classes, and margo runs
both halves (see `margo/src/tests/fixture.rs` for the rationale, paraphrasing
niri's "~5,280 snapshots *and* a fixture harness"):

- **Unit / snapshot** locks *pure logic* — layout arithmetic, LUT generation,
  schedule math. The layout engine alone has **38 `insta` text snapshots**
  (`margo/src/layout/snapshots/`) plus the colour/twilight unit suites
  (`render/icc_lut`, `render/hdr_metadata`, `twilight/*`). These don't touch
  the wire.
- **Runtime (integration fixture)** locks *protocol behaviour over a real
  connection* — `wl_registry.bind`, `wl_display.sync`, server dispatch order,
  configure-event sequencing. This is the only column that proves the
  advertised global is wired to a working handler.

🟢 (CI integration) is strictly stronger evidence than 🟡 (manual): 🟢 runs on
every push and can't silently rot; 🟡 depends on a human walking the checklist
on real DRM hardware that GitHub runners can't provide.

## Legend

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | yes / shipped |
| ⚠️ | partial — see the gap note |
| 🟢 | covered by a CI headless-integration fixture test |
| 🟡 | covered only by the manual on-hardware checklist |
| ❌ | not covered |

## Core baseline

The registry globals every Wayland client expects. `globals.rs` (3 tests)
asserts the advertised set, so the *advertisement* of this whole block is
runtime-checked even where the per-protocol behaviour isn't.

## Coverage summary

- **Advertised & implemented:** every protocol in this matrix (no advertise-only
  stubs — `⚠️` rows are *partial behaviour*, not missing handlers).
- **Runtime-tested in CI (🟢):** the protocol areas above via `margo/src/tests/`
  (`globals`, `xdg_shell`, `xdg_decoration`, `xdg_activation`, `layer_shell`,
  `session_lock`, `xwayland_shell`, `pointer_constraints`, `output_management`,
  `color_management`, `gamma_control`, `screencopy`, `dmabuf`, `idle`,
  `selection`) plus the multi-monitor *internal* paths (`output_assignment`,
  `focus_mon`, `tag_mon`) — the latter drive a real focused toplevel through the
  fixture (see `add_keyboard`).
- **Unit / snapshot:** concentrated in the **render/colour/twilight** stack and
  the **layout engine** (38 layout snapshots) — pure-logic surfaces. The wire
  protocols mostly rely on the integration fixture instead, by design.
- **🟡 manual-only / ❌ untested:** the long tail (input extensions, capture
  loop, sync/timing, security-context, foreign-toplevel/workspace). These are
  the **snapshot/integration backlog**.

### Next integration-fixture targets (the riskiest untested paths)

Ordered by blast radius, matching the agreed first wave. The first two
landed (2026-06-01); the remainder are the live backlog:

1. ~~**tag move across outputs** (`tagmon`) — highest-risk because it mutates
   per-output state in one step.~~ ✅ `tag_mon.rs` (4 tests).
2. ~~**multi-monitor output assignment** (placement + per-output pertag +
   per-output tag rules).~~ ✅ `output_assignment.rs` (4) + `focus_mon.rs` (4).
3. **layer-shell popup / menu** grab + dismiss — fixture has the surface, not the
   popup-grab path.
4. **focus restore after unmap / lock** — `session_lock.rs` covers lock, not the
   post-unlock focus stack. (`add_keyboard` fixture helper, added for `tag_mon`,
   now unblocks this.)
5. **floating-over-tiled** stacking + focus.
6. **scroller offscreen focus** (focus a window scrolled out of view) — the
   overview has 6 tests; the offscreen-focus scroll-into-view path is separate.

See `road_map.md` §15.2 (test coverage) for the running backlog; this matrix is the
evidence table that feeds it.
