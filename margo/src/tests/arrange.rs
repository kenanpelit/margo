//! `focused_tiled_pos` — the anchor slot focus-following layouts
//! (scroller, vertical scroller, deck) centre on.
//!
//! Locks the fix for "a floating keyring / polkit dialog grabbing focus
//! snaps the scroller strip to window 1". The naive lookup returns `None`
//! when focus is off the tiled strip, and every consumer then falls back
//! to slot 0; `focused_tiled_pos` instead holds the strip on the
//! most-recently-focused window that is still tiled (per-monitor MRU
//! `focus_history`, most-recent first).
